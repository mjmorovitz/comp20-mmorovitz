COMP 20 Fall 2014 Private Repo for Maretta Morovitz
This repository was used to store labs and assignments for th Fall 2014 Comp20 class at Tufts University. 

My favorite assignment was the final semester project. This project gave me the opportunity to combine all of the different topics as well as to explore new topics such as using teh Facebook Developer API and bootstraps frameworks. Additionally, this project gave me the freedom to design something without the limitations of other assignments in regard to structure, functionality, and appearance. 
I have definitely grown from day one. One of the most important ways that I have grown is in independence as a programmer. Coming from comp11, I was use to every assignment being outlined to the last detail, an army of TAs ready in Halligan at all times, and class lectures that went over every aspect of a topic. In Comp20 I was able to learn a lot more and explore mre into topics taht interested me. additionally, I learned how to use the multitude of online resources to complete projects. I became more independent on assignmnets. This is most evident in the semster project which I completed sections with tools I was not familiar with without relying on the professor or TAs to walk me through hwo to do it.
Two of the most important things I learned were:
1. Don't reinvent the wheel: Many cool and useful features and tools are already out there, so I should not waste my time creating them from scratch. For example, in the semster project, I realized Facebook already had a way of logging in. So, rather than creating a login for my page I could just use the one facebook already built.
2. Don't be afraid to ask questions: Everyone was a beginning at some point and the only way to make progress is to learn more which can only be accomplished trhough asking questions. For example, I spent at least a few hours trying to store user profile pictures from the facebook API. About to give up, I posted a question to piazza and sure enough Ming's answer worked. By asking for help I was able to correctly implement that aspect of my project and move on to more exciting parts of the project.
An area I am interested in learning more about is securty. This is something I hope to get involved in this summer through my internship at MITRE. And in a few semesters I will see you in your security class Ming!

Thank you for a great semester!
