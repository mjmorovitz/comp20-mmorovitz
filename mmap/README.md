All aspects of this project were implemented sucessfully. The map displays properly with all required features including:
Using a JSON API.
Using a third-party JavaScript API, Google Maps.
Using the HTML5 geolocation API to determine your location.
Using event handling.
Using the XMLHttpRequest object to make requests and manage the response data.

The total time spent working on thus project was around 8 hours. Help for this project was given my Professor Ming Chow, TA Andrew Dempsey, and the documentation for Google Maps. Additionally features were implemented based off of the Geolocation Program given as an example. Also, the distance formula was based on code found at the link given as an example: http://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/latlong.html
